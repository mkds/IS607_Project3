That agreement gave studios the right to omit from the screen the name of any individual who had failed to clear himself before a duly constituted legislative committee of Congress if accused of Communist affiliations; as was the case with Wilson at the time. The Academy; in the awkward position of possibly conferring its highest honor on someone whose name had been omitted from screen credit; revised its bylaws at a special February 6; 1957; meeting. That revision; in essence; allowed that in such cases; the achievement itself could be eligible for nomination; but the specific writer would be ineligible. The following instructions were sent to Price Waterhouse & Co.; Certified Public Accountants; who tabulated Academy ballots: "...we ask that if; in tabulating the nominations ballots for Best Screenplay (adapted); Friendly Persuasion is one of the five nominations; you list the other four alphabetically by title and below: Friendly Persuasion - Achievement nominated; but writer ineligible for Award under Academy By-Laws." On February 17; 1957; the Academy's Board of Governors voted to instruct Price Waterhouse & Co. "...to list five nominations; and in the event that one of these is declared ineligible under the By-Law provision; four nominations would appear on the final ballot." THIS NOMINATION WAS NOT INCLUDED ON THE FINAL BALLOT. (The bylaw was repealed by the Academy as "unworkable" on January 12; 1959.) On December 10; 2002; the Academy's Board of Governors voted to reinstate Mr. Wilson's nomination.],[NOTE: Early in 1956; the name of blacklisted screenwriter Michael Wilson had been deleted from the screen credits of Friendly Persuasion by Allied Artists; the film's distributor; based on a 1952 agreement between the Screen Writers Guild and various production companies.
